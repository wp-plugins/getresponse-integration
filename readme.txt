GetResponse Integration

This plug-in enables installation of a GetResponse fully customizable sign up form on your WordPress site or blog. Once a web form is created and added to the site the visitors are automatically added to your GetResponse contact list and sent a confirmation email. The plug-in additionally offers sign-up upon leaving a comment.

1. Download the GetResponse plug-in for your WordPress version.
2. Unzip the downloaded file and extract the code to to your /wp-content/plugins/ folder.

Plug-in update:

Note that the web form installed via the old version of the plug-in will still be fully operational, so you do not need to replace it with the new one. If you want to add the new “Subscribe via comment” function, simply delete old plug-in and install new – and use the same web form ID.
